    "    The input images and output labels need to be standardized. This way, you can analyze all the input images using the same classification pipeline, and you know what output to expect when you eventually classify a *new* image.\n",

    "3. **Feature extraction**. \n",
    "    Next, you'll extract some features from each image that will help distinguish and eventually classify these images.\n",

    "4. **Classification and visualizing error**. \n",
